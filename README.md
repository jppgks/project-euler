## Purpose
Be an educational journey for myself.

The language I choose for solving the problem is determined only by personal preference / importance / interest at the time of solving.
Therefore, I do not claim to choose the "best" language to solve the problem in.

## Collaborating
The purpose of this repository is personal education.

**However**, if you encounter something in my code that can be more readable / efficient or improved otherwise, I will be glad to learn from you and accept a PR.
